# keyball44 keymap

This is a repository for managing the QMK keymap for my keyball44 keyboard.

## Editing the keymap

1. Edit `keyball/keyball44/keymaps/default/keymap.c`
2. Push to GitHub
3. Download the artifact from `build QMK` GitHub Actions workflow
4. Flash to both halves of keyball44 using [Pro Micro Web Updater](https://sekigon-gonnoc.github.io/promicro-web-updater/index.html) in Chrome
    - NOTE: keyball44 must be connected to Mac using a data compatible cable
